# Basic React Blog
Just a simple blog to allow me to record anything of interest as I continue learning all things related to code. 

## Stack
Using a PERN stack
Postgres
Express
React
Node

## Status
Currently have a basic shell of an application which allows me to navigate to an editor page to submit a post - currently not functioning. 
The navigator page has a preview box utilising github flavoured markdown. 

## Todo 
- Setup the express API to allow for CRUD requests from the blog. 
- Tie in functionality from the blog to the API. 
- Add in ability to create tags, tag posts, and sort posts by tags.
